Build a simple SaaS-style Invoice Generator Web App using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The app should allow users to input their details (business name, client name, invoice number, date, item list with price & quantity, tax/discount). After entering data, the app should generate a clean, professional invoice layout that can be previewed on the page. Also, add a button to Download Invoice as PDF. Make sure the design looks modern, responsive, and user-friendly (using Bootstrap cards, form inputs, and tables). Add branding placeholder (like company logo upload option). Keep the code well-structured and commented.
